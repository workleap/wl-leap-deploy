**Any code you commit SHOULD compile, and new and existing tests related to the change SHOULD pass.**

You MUST make your best effort to ensure your changes satisfy those criteria before committing. If for any reason you were unable to build or test the changes, you MUST report that. You MUST NOT claim success unless all builds and tests pass as described above.

Do not complete without checking the relevant code builds and relevant tests still pass after the last edits you make. Do not simply assume that your changes fix test failures you see, actually build and run those tests again to confirm.
Also, do not assume that tests pass just because you did not see any failures in your last test run; verify that all relevant tests were actually run.

# How to build and test

The project uses the following Makefile commands to build and test the code:

**Build, Lint, and Validate:**

- `make all` — Runs validation, linting, and tests (default target)
- `make validate` — Validates schemas against metaschema, conventions, and test inputs/assertions
- `make lint` — Lints schema files
- `make format` — Formats schema files

**Testing:**

- `make test` — Runs all tests (same as `make test/folding`)
- `make test/folding` — Runs folding tests and asserts against expected outputs

**Other Useful Commands:**

- `make clean` — Cleans build/test output
- `make help` — Shows all available Makefile targets

## Windows Users

If you are using Windows and do not have a suitable environment for running `make`, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For instance, you can run the build using `wsl -- make all`
